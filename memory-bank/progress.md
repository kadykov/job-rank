# Progress: Job Description Ranker

**Date:** 2025-04-23 (Updated 2025-04-23 09:51 UTC)

**Current Status:** Core logic refactored into a testable pipeline function (`run_ranking_pipeline`). Basic unit test added for the pipeline.

**What Works:**
- Project setup complete (Memory Bank, `.clinerules`, data files, `.gitignore`, dependencies).
- Project structure updated to `src` layout and installed editable.
- **Configuration:**
    - Settings loaded from `config.yaml`, including `explanation_threshold`.
    - LLM prompts loaded from external files (`prompts/`).
- **Ideal CV Generation:**
    - System prompt (`prompts/system_message.txt`) refined to produce cleaner, more focused ideal CVs (excluding placeholders).
- **Caching:**
    - Ideal CVs and embeddings are cached based on JD content and config.
    - **Explanations are now cached** based on ideal CV key, user CV, explanation prompt, and LLM config.
    - Cache hits/misses are handled for both ideal CVs/embeddings and explanations.
- **Core Logic:**
    - Helper functions for API key loading, model initialization, text loading, ideal CV generation, embedding, similarity calculation, caching, and explanation generation are implemented in `rank_jobs.py`.
    - **`run_ranking_pipeline` function encapsulates the core workflow and returns structured results.**
    - **`main` function acts as the CLI entry point, calling the pipeline and printing results.**
- **Explainability:**
    - LLM-based explanation generated *only if* similarity score >= `explanation_threshold`.
    - Explanation (or skipped message) included in the final ranked output.
    - Explanation caching implemented to reduce redundant LLM calls.
- **Testing:**
    - `pytest` framework set up.
    - Unit tests for `load_config` function pass.
    - Unit tests for ideal CV/embedding caching functions pass using mocks.
    - **Basic unit test for `run_ranking_pipeline` added (`tests/test_pipeline.py`), using mocks and passing.**
- **Developer Tooling:**
    - `justfile` provides comprehensive commands for running, testing, linting, formatting, and cache management.
- **Type Checking:**
    - `mypy` runs successfully after fixing `sklearn` import issue.

**What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps):**
1.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md` to explain how users can configure `config.yaml` to use their own local CV and JD files.
2.  **Refinement:**
    - Analyze the quality and usefulness of generated "Explanations" (for scores >= threshold).
    - Refine `prompts/explanation_prompt.txt` if necessary.
3.  **Further Testing:** Consider adding more detailed tests for `run_ranking_pipeline` (e.g., testing cache hits specifically) and tests for explanation caching functions.
4.  **Future Features:** Discuss and prioritize next major features (e.g., Web UI, multi-lingual support, optimization).

**Known Issues:**
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` to function fully.
