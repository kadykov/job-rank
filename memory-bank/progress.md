# Progress: Job Description Ranker

**Date:** 2025-04-20 (Updated 2025-04-20 11:06 UTC)

**Current Status:** Feature implementation (Config, Cache, Explainability) complete. Basic unit tests added.

**What Works:**
- Project setup complete (Memory Bank, `.clinerules`, data files, `.gitignore`, dependencies).
- Project structure updated to `src` layout and installed editable.
- **Configuration:**
    - Settings loaded from `config.yaml`.
    - LLM prompts loaded from external files (`prompts/`).
- **Caching:**
    - Ideal CVs and embeddings are cached based on JD content and config.
    - Cache hits/misses are handled during processing.
- **Core Logic:**
    - Functions for API key loading, model initialization, text loading, ideal CV generation, embedding, similarity calculation, and explanation generation are implemented in `src/rank_jobs.py`.
    - Main execution logic orchestrates the workflow using config, caching, and explanation generation.
- **Explainability:**
    - LLM-based explanation generated for each CV/Ideal CV pair.
    - Explanation included in the final ranked output.
- **Testing:**
    - `pytest` framework set up.
    - Unit tests for `load_config` function pass.
    - Unit tests for caching functions (`get_cache_key`, `get_cache_paths`, `load_from_cache`, `save_to_cache`) pass using mocks.

**What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps):**
1.  **End-to-End Testing:** Run `python src/rank_jobs.py` to test the full workflow with actual API calls (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`).
2.  **Refinement:**
    - Analyze the quality of generated "Ideal CVs".
    - Analyze the quality and usefulness of generated "Explanations".
    - Refine prompts (`system_message.txt`, `explanation_prompt.txt`) if necessary.
    - Review the ranking logic and output format.
3.  **Memory Bank Update:** Update `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the current architecture.
4.  **Further Testing:** Consider adding integration tests (mocking external APIs) or tests for the core logic functions (`generate_ideal_cv`, `get_embedding`, `calculate_similarity`, `generate_explanation`).

**Known Issues:**
- Script has not yet been run end-to-end with the new features integrated.
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` to function fully.
- `mypy` still reports missing stubs for `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` (minor type checking issue).
