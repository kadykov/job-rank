# Active Context: Job Description Ranker - Modularization & Pipeline Testing

**Date:** 2025-04-23 (Updated 2025-04-23 09:52 UTC)

**Current Focus:** Completing the modularization refactor and ensuring basic test coverage for the core pipeline.

**Recent Changes:**
- **Modularization:** Refactored `rank_jobs.py` by extracting the core logic into a new `run_ranking_pipeline` function that returns structured data. The `main` function now serves solely as the CLI entry point, calling the pipeline and printing results.
- **Testing:** Added a new test file `tests/test_pipeline.py` with a unit test (`test_run_ranking_pipeline_success`) for the core pipeline function, using mocking for external dependencies. All tests are passing.
- **Memory Bank Update:** Updated `systemPatterns.md` and `progress.md` to reflect the refactoring and test addition.

**Previous Changes (Relevant):**
- **Developer Tooling (`justfile`):** Refined `justfile` commands.
- **Type Hint Fix:** Resolved `mypy` error for `sklearn`.
- **Ideal CV Prompt Refinement:** Updated `prompts/system_message.txt`.
- **Explanation Threshold & Caching:** Implemented conditional explanation generation/caching.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md` to explain how users can configure `config.yaml` to use their own local CV and JD files (as identified in `progress.md`).
2.  **Refinement/Further Testing:** Consider analyzing explanation quality, refining prompts, or adding more detailed tests as outlined in `progress.md`.
3.  **Future Features:** Discuss and prioritize next major features (e.g., Web UI, multi-lingual support, optimization).

**Open Questions/Decisions:**
- Is the default `explanation_threshold` of 0.6 appropriate? (Can be adjusted in `config.yaml`).
- Is the quality of the generated explanations acceptable? (Needs review).
